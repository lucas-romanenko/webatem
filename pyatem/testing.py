"""Test doubles for pyatem — no live ATEM required.

``FakeAtemProtocol`` mimics the surface pyatem.connection.ATEMConnection
actually exercises (connect / blocking loop / send_commands / mixerstate /
on / transport.thread_recv_queue), configurable per-test:

  * connect_delay   — sleep inside connect() before firing 'connected'
  * loop_blocks     — loop() blocks on thread_recv_queue (real behaviour)
  * fail_connect / fail_loop_after / fail_loop_exception — failure modes

Used by pyatem's own tests and by av_server's orchestration tests (the
capture pipeline, media-pool watcher, uploader hygiene). Fixtures that
install these doubles live in the repo-root conftest.py.
