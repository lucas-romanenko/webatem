"""
Ref-counted singleton-per-IP pool of ``ATEMConnection`` instances.

Multiple callers — different browser tabs, the media pool watcher, etc. —
need to share one UDP socket per ATEM rather than each opening their own.
``ATEMInstanceManager`` keeps a module-level dict keyed by IP; each caller
acquires a ref via ``get_instance(ip)`` and releases it via
``release_instance(ip)``. When the last reference goes away the connection
is torn down after a 2-second grace period via ``threading.Timer``, giving
quick page transitions a window to reuse the existing socket.

IMPORTANT — single-Uvicorn-worker invariant: the instance dict is
process-local. Multiple Uvicorn workers would each get independent copies,
break reference counting and create duplicate ATEM connections. See
CLAUDE.md in the app repo for the rationale.

Threading contract
==================

Two layers of locking:

    ``_instance_lock`` (class-level) guards ``_instances`` dict structure
    and per-entry ref_count / disconnect_timer / state.

    ``ATEMConnection._lifecycle_lock`` (instance-level) guards the
    connect/disconnect transitions on a single connection.

Lifecycle states (tracked in the ``state`` field of each entry):

    ACTIVE         entry exists, refcount > 0, worker alive (or being
                   started). New get_instance increments refcount.
    DRAINING       entry exists, refcount == 0, grace timer armed. New
                   get_instance cancels the timer and transitions back
                   to ACTIVE without re-handshaking.
    TEARING_DOWN   timer fired and is currently inside the callback,
                   actively disconnecting. New get_instance MUST wait
                   for the callback to complete (releases the lock).
                   When the callback returns, the entry has been
                   removed from the dict, and get_instance creates a
                   fresh ACTIVE entry.

Transitions are atomic — they all happen while holding ``_instance_lock``,
except that the actual ``connection.disconnect()`` call inside
TEARING_DOWN is the long part. Importantly, ``disconnect()`` now wakes the
worker before joining (see ``ATEMConnection._disconnect_locked``), so the
TEARING_DOWN state is brief (< 100ms typical, < 2s pathological) — the
historical 4-second pathology is gone.

Race window the historical bug exploited (now fixed):

  1. Refcount → 0. Timer armed (DRAINING).
  2. Timer fires. State → TEARING_DOWN. ``connection.disconnect()`` runs.
  3. Worker is blocked in protocol.loop() → thread_recv_queue.get().
     Setting _stop_event doesn't wake it. ``worker.join(timeout=2.0)``
     exhausts. Disconnect returns "complete" but the worker is alive.
  4. ``del cls._instances[ip]``. Lock released.
  5. Concurrent get_instance acquires lock, ip not in dict, creates a
     fresh instance.
  6. The OLD worker is orphan, holds OLD socket, still ACKs ATEM
     packets on OLD session. ATEM has TWO active sessions. State
     events / capture responses may go to OLD; NEW's mixerstate
     doesn't update; capture timeout.

The fix: ``ATEMConnection._disconnect_locked`` now wakes the worker via
``transport.thread_recv_queue.put(None)`` BEFORE joining. The worker
unblocks, observes ``_stop_event``, exits its main loop, closes its
socket — all within a few milliseconds. The TEARING_DOWN state is brief
and the new instance can never see an orphaned old worker.

Defence in depth:

  * ATEMConnection.is_connected now reflects worker liveness (it reads
    self._worker.is_alive()). A connection whose worker died for ANY
    reason — bug, OS error, force-kill — flips to is_connected=False
    immediately. acquire_connection's healing path (call conn.connect()
    if not is_connected) replaces the dead worker with a fresh one
    using the same ATEMConnection object.
  * ATEMConnection.send() raises ConnectionDeadError instead of
    silently queuing into a dead worker's queue.
  * The pool's get_instance verifies health on return (logs a warning
    if it returned a connection whose worker is not alive — which
    should now be impossible, but if it ever happens we want loud
    evidence not a 10s capture timeout).
