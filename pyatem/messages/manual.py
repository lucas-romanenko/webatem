"""
Manual / catch-all field — lets callers construct a fake "received"
field with any 4-char code and arbitrary raw bytes. Used by tests and
any feature that needs to synthesize a packet outside the normal
``FIELDNAME_PRETTY`` dispatch.

Doesn't fit the DSL pattern (the wire CODE is dynamic, not class-level)
so it lives as a hand-written subclass.
