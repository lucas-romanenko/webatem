"""
Thread-safe wrapper around ``AtemProtocol``.

pyatem's ``AtemProtocol`` is NOT thread-safe — ``loop()``,
``send_commands()``, and any other direct protocol calls must all happen on
one thread. ``ATEMConnection`` runs them on a dedicated worker thread; any
other thread wanting to send a command uses ``send(cmd)`` which enqueues
via a ``queue.Queue``.

The worker thread opens the pyatem connection, waits for the initial state
dump via ``pyatem.ready.wait_ready``, then pumps ``loop()`` and drains the
outgoing command queue until stopped.

Threading contract
==================

State guarded by ``_lifecycle_lock``:
    is_connected, ip_address, _protocol, _worker, _stop_event,
    _ready_event, _connect_error.

Worker liveness states (informal, reflected via ``is_connected`` +
``_worker.is_alive()``):

    [absent]     no worker has been started      _worker is None
    starting     worker thread started, not yet  _worker.is_alive(),
                 ready                            is_connected=False,
                                                  _ready_event clear
    ready        worker pumping protocol.loop    _worker.is_alive(),
                                                  is_connected=True,
                                                  _ready_event set
    stopping     _stop_event set, worker         _worker.is_alive(),
                 winding down                     is_connected=False
    dead         worker has exited               not _worker.is_alive(),
                                                  is_connected=False

``send()`` raises ``ConnectionDeadError`` if the worker is not in the
``ready`` state — i.e. if the queue would silently fill with no drain.
This is the contract that prevents the historical "command goes nowhere
and we wait 10s for a state update that never comes" failure mode.

Disconnect protocol:
    1. Set ``_stop_event``.
    2. Wake the worker out of its blocking ``thread_recv_queue.get()`` by
       putting ``None`` on ``transport.thread_recv_queue``. Otherwise the
       worker would never see ``_stop_event`` and ``worker.join`` would
       time out, leaving an orphan thread holding the socket.
    3. Join the worker (timeout=2.0s).
    4. If the worker did still not exit (extreme case — daemon thread
       is dead, or a bug elsewhere), close the socket from outside as a
       last-resort kick. The worker's next ``protocol.loop`` raises and
       the worker exits via the exception path.
    5. Drop references.
