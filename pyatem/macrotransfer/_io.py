"""Macro file-transfer I/O — download from + upload to the ATEM's macro store.

Two notable wire-format quirks distinguish the macro store from the
still store:

1. **No locking.** A still download starts with PLCK and waits for
   LKOB; a macro download skips both and goes straight to FTSU. This
   matches what ATEM Software Control does — its Wireshark capture for
   "Save As → Macros only" shows only FTSU/FTUA from client to switcher.

2. **Mode bits in FTSD** (upload only): the still store accepts mode
   0x0001 (Write RLE), the macro store requires 0x0300 (Write
   uncompressed + Pre-erase). The wrong mode is rejected with FTDE
   code 2 ("not-found"). Driven by upstream
   ``protocol._transfer_trigger`` based on store id.

Both directions ride the native file-transfer state machine
(``protocol.download`` / ``protocol.upload``) — transfers interleave
with control traffic on the connection's normal packet loop (the old
direct-socket takeover is gone, ASC-style step 6, 2026-07-02). The
FTDC handler RLE-decodes store 0 only, so macro downloads arrive as
the raw bytes ``decode_macro_bytecode`` expects.

      client → ATEM:  FTSD (start: store=0xFFFF, slot, len, mode=0x0300)

    Mode bits in FTSD (per OpenSwitcher / upstream
    ``TransferUploadRequestCommand``): bit 0 = Write RLE, bit 1 = Clear,
    bit 8 = Write uncompressed, bit 9 = Pre-erase. The macro store
    requires ``0x0300`` (uncompressed + pre-erase) — what Software
    Control's "Restore from State" sends, verified empirically against
    ``macroRestore2.pcap``. ``0x0001`` (Write RLE), which the still
    store accepts, is rejected by the macro store with ``FTDE`` code 2
    ("not-found"). The mode is selected by upstream
    ``protocol._transfer_trigger`` based on store id.

    The macro store does NOT require explicit PLCK/LKOB locking before
    upload (verified by the same capture, which goes straight to FTSD).
    This is the asymmetry with the still store (which does require
    locks).

    No live ATEM state changes during the transfer — the bytecode lands
    directly in the macro slot.

    Caller contract: someone must be pumping ``protocol.loop()`` while
    this function blocks. In production that's the ``ATEMConnection``
    worker thread; in tests/scripts that's a manual loop on the calling
    thread. This function does NOT pump the loop itself, because pumping
    would race with the worker when one exists.
