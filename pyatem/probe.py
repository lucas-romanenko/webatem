"""
ATEM device info probe — read a few identity fields from a connection.

Intended for UIs that want to show "what kind of ATEM is at this IP, and
what video mode is it running." Goes through ``pyatem.pool.acquire_connection``
so a probe hits the warm path (~0ms) when the pool already has a connection
for this IP — and pays the full handshake cost only on a cold pool miss.

Callers that want rate-limiting or caching should wrap this in their own
layer; this module intentionally has no opinion about caching policy.

Returned dict shape:
    {
        'video_format':      '1080p50' (str) or None,
        'atem_model':        'ATEM 1 M/E Production Studio 4K' (str) or None,
        'connection_status': bool,
        'error':             str   # only present on exception
    }
