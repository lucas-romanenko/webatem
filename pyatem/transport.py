        switcher refuses all new connections and/or never grants the
        media lock, which reads as a "wedged network engine" that only a
        power cycle clears (observed live on two switchers, 2026-07-02).
        Every close path must call this BEFORE ``sock.close()``.

        Fire-and-forget: one datagram, no wait for the ATEM's reply —
        we're tearing down regardless, and a lost goodbye is no worse
        than the old behaviour.
