"""Unit tests for pyatem.connection.ATEMConnection.

Focus: the threading contract and the dead-worker detection.

The historical bug these tests defend against:

  * The worker thread parks on ``thread_recv_queue.get()`` — a blocking
    call with no timeout. ``_stop_event.set()`` does NOT wake it.
    ``worker.join(timeout=2.0)`` exhausts; the worker is orphaned.
  * Callers calling ``send()`` on a connection whose worker is dead
    silently queue commands that nobody drains. This used to manifest
    as 10-second capture timeouts whose error message was "ATEM did
    not populate a new media pool slot. Is the media pool full?" — a
    completely misleading diagnosis.

The fix verified here:

  * ``_disconnect_locked`` puts None on ``thread_recv_queue`` to wake
    the worker BEFORE joining. Disconnect completes in milliseconds.
  * ``is_connected`` reflects worker liveness (worker.is_alive() AND
    handshake_done).
  * ``send()`` raises ``ConnectionDeadError`` instead of silently
    queuing.
  * The ``on_died`` callback fires once on unexpected worker exit.

    Historical bug: ``send()`` only put the command on ``_cmd_queue`` and

    ``_drain_cmd_queue``. But ``loop()`` blocks indefinitely inside
    ``transport.receive_packet`` while ATEM is sending only PINGs
    (length-12 packets that never break out of the inner ``while True``).
    So a queued ``CaptureStillCommand`` could sit unsent for tens of
    seconds — observed as "Phase 1 timeout" because ATEM never received
    the ``Capt`` we thought we sent.

    Fix: ``send()`` now also puts a ``Wakeup`` sentinel on
    ``thread_recv_queue`` so ``loop()`` returns within microseconds and
    ``_drain_cmd_queue()`` ships the command immediately.
