"""Unit tests for pyatem.pool.ATEMInstanceManager.

These exercise the full lifecycle:

  ABSENT → ACTIVE → DRAINING → TEARING_DOWN → ABSENT

with focus on the historical race: TEARING_DOWN must complete before a
concurrent get_instance can either reacquire (cancelling the timer) or
create a fresh entry (after the entry has been deleted). The fix to
ATEMConnection._disconnect_locked makes TEARING_DOWN brief, so the
race window that produced silent zombie connections is eliminated.
