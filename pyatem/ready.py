"""
Wait for a pyatem connection to complete its initial state dump.

"Ready" means: pyatem has fired the 'connected' event (which happens at
the END of the initial state dump — see protocol.py) AND 'video-mode' is
present in mixerstate. Almost every caller in this codebase used to open
its own socket, call protocol.connect(), then spin on this same two-part
condition with slightly different timeouts and sleep intervals.

The caller is responsible for calling ``protocol.connect()`` before
invoking ``wait_ready()``. This helper only waits; it does not open the
connection.
