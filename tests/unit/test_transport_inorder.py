"""Transport in-order delivery gate (2026-07-02, ASC-style step 1).

The KI #22 fix made the ACK stream gap-correct, but packets were still
DELIVERED to consumers in arrival order — a retransmitted packet landed
late, and the native transfer path appended its file chunk out of order,
corrupting the reassembled frame (observed live: 2 of 4 benchmark
downloads returned odd lengths from single-packet loss).

Contract under test, driving real datagrams through _receive_packet_low:
  * in-order reliable packets pass straight through (no behaviour change);
  * an ahead-of-gap packet is parked (consumer sees nothing for it yet);
  * when the gap fills, the filler AND its parked successors are pushed to
    thread_recv_queue in sequence order;
  * duplicates behind the cursor are dropped; flagged retransmit dups of
    anything already received are dropped (existing rule);
  * 15-bit wraparound (the ATEM wraps at 0x8000);
  * an absurd forward jump resyncs (delivers, drops stale parked) instead
    of deadlocking;
  * non-reliable control frames bypass the gate entirely.
