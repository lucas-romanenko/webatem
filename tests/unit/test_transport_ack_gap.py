"""Inbound contiguous-ACK gap detection — Known Issue #22.

The ATEM dumps its initial state as a burst of reliable, sequenced packets and
retransmits anything we don't ACK. The transport must ACK only the highest
*gap-free* sequence, so a dropped packet in the middle of the burst is resent
instead of silently swallowed (which left sources blank in the UI). These tests
drive ``UdpProtocol._update_ack_number`` with scripted arrival orders.
